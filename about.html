            Hi, I'm Aly Soliman. I'm a Software Engineer at Western University in London Ontario.
             I have a passion for software development and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.
              I have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Python, C++, and C.
               I'm also familiar with web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects 
               and learning new things. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contributing to the tech community.
